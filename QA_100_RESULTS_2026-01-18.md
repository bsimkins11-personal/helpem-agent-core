## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Title Extraction (Q1)
**Problem:** "Add buy milk to my list" → missing title  
**Fix:** Added instruction to extract clean titles by removing filler words
```
"Add buy milk to my list" → title: "buy milk"
"Remind me to call dad" → title: "call dad"
```

### 2. Schedule vs Appointment Confusion (Q9)
**Problem:** "Schedule dentist checkup" classified as appointment instead of todo  
**Fix:** Clarified category selection logic
- **Appointment:** Requires BOTH time AND date provided
  - ✅ "Dentist at 3pm tomorrow" = APPOINTMENT
- **Todo:** Task to schedule something (no time given)
  - ✅ "Schedule dentist checkup" = TODO

### 3. Time Pressure Priority (Q48)
**Problem:** "Meeting in 30 minutes - print docs" not detected as high priority  
**Fix:** Added time pressure detection
- "in X minutes/hours" where X < 2 hours → HIGH priority

### 4. Grocery Store Task (Q79)
**Problem:** Test expected this to fail, but it correctly handled as TODO  
**Status:** Working as intended - "Go to grocery store" is a task, not a grocery item

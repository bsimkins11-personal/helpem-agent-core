## Support Strategy (AI-First)

### The Three-Tier Defense

#### Tier 1: AI Support Bot (70-80% Deflection) 🤖

**Already built** ✅

**Examples:**
- "How do I add a todo?" → AI answers instantly
- "Where is my data stored?" → AI links to docs
- "Can I export my data?" → AI explains + links to feature
- "How do I cancel?" → AI shows Apple Subscriptions link

**Cost:** $0 (part of app)  
**Deflection Rate:** 70-80%  
**User Experience:** Instant answers

---

#### Tier 2: Help Center / FAQ (15-20% Deflection) 📚

**Content Needed:**
- Getting started guide
- How to: Add todos, appointments, habits
- Voice commands guide
- Billing & subscription FAQs
- Export & backup instructions
- Troubleshooting common issues

**Tool:** Simple knowledge base (Notion, Gitbook, or custom)  
**Cost:** $0-50/month  
**Deflection Rate:** 15-20% (after AI)

---

#### Tier 3: Human Email Support (5-10% Remaining) 👤

**Volume Projection:**

| MAUs | Paid Users | Tickets/Month | Support Hours/Week |
|------|------------|---------------|-------------------|
| 100 | 30 | 3 | 1 hour |
| 500 | 150 | 15 | 3 hours |
| 1,000 | 400 | 40 | 8 hours |
| 5,000 | 2,000 | 200 | 40 hours (1 FTE) |
| 10,000 | 4,000 | 400 | 80 hours (2 FTE) |

**Calculation:**
- AI deflects 70%
- FAQ deflects another 20%
- Only 10% reach human support
- Of 4,000 paid users: 4,000 × 0.10 = 400 tickets/month

**Cost:**
- 0-1,000 MAUs: Founder (manageable)
- 1,000-5,000 MAUs: Founder + VA part-time ($500/mo)
- 5,000+ MAUs: 1 FTE ($4,000/mo)

**SLA by Tier:**
- **Basic:** 5-7 business days
- **Premium:** 24-48 hours

## Support Economics (CFO Analysis)

### Cost Per Ticket

**Without AI Support:**
- Deflection: 0%
- Tickets/month (4,000 users): 1,200
- Support FTE needed: 3 FTE @ $4K = $12,000/month
- Cost per ticket: $10

**With AI Support (Your Setup):**
- Deflection: 70-80%
- Tickets/month (4,000 users): 240-360
- Support FTE needed: 0.5 FTE = $2,000/month
- Cost per ticket: $5.56-8.33

**Savings:** $10,000/month at 10K MAUs 🚀

---

### The "0.3 Tickets/User/Month" Threshold

**CFO Guardrail:** If Basic users exceed 0.3 tickets/user/month, margins collapse.

**Your Reality:**
- AI deflects 70%
- FAQ deflects 20%
- Human tickets: 10% of issues
- Typical issues/user/month: 0.5
- Human tickets/user/month: **0.05** ✅ (10× below threshold)

**Verdict:** Your AI support makes this model sustainable even at 10K users.

- Financial protection (edge case users)
- 99.9% of users never hit this
- Not enforced, just disclosed

**CFO Verdict:** Required for risk management. ✅

---

### 3. AI Support First Line

---

## Biggest Financial Risks

### ⚠️ Real Risks (Not Token Costs)

#### 1. Support Scaling Quietly

**Symptoms:**
- Tickets/user/month > 0.3
- Founder spending >20 hrs/week on support
- Premium SLA slipping past 48 hours

**Mitigation:**
- Monitor tickets/user/month metric weekly
- Improve AI support coverage (add more Q&A)
- Hire support FTE at 5K users if needed

---

#### 2. Prompt Bloat Increasing Token Costs

**Symptoms:**
- Average message cost > $0.0006
- System prompt growing beyond 5K tokens
- Context memory causing high costs

**Mitigation:**
- Monitor token usage per message
- Optimize system prompt quarterly
- Use summary instead of full history (Premium memory)

---

#### 3. Abuse by Edge-Case Power Users

**Symptoms:**
- Single user sending 5,000+ messages/month
- API calls for automation (scripts)
- Data export abuse

**Mitigation:**
- Fair use policy (3,000 msgs/month)
- Rate limiting (50 msgs/hour)
- Friendly email if abuse detected (not hard block)

---

#### 4. Founder Time Diverted to Billing Infrastructure

**Symptoms:**
- Building custom subscription backend
- Debugging receipt validation
- Handling refund requests manually

**Mitigation:**
- **Use RevenueCat** (already planned) ✅
- Apple handles refunds automatically
- Focus on product, not payments

---

## Final CFO Grade: A

### Why A (Upgraded from A-)

**You win because:**

1. ✅ **Flat marginal cost curve** (voice = $0, LLM = $0.18)
2. ✅ **Free tier is cheap marketing** ($0.12/user with 100 msgs)
3. ✅ **Pricing matches habit formation** ($4.99/$9.99 psychology)
4. ✅ **Architecture avoids "voice tax"** (competitors pay $4/user)
5. ✅ **AI support deflects 70-80%** (saves $10K/mo at scale)

**Adjustments Made:**
- ✅ Free tier: 50 → 100 messages (better retention)
- ✅ Premium fair use: Added 3,000 msg cap (legal protection)
- ✅ Support strategy: AI-first, human-second (scales efficiently)

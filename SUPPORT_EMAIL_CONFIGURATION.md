# Support Email Configuration

**Official Support Email:** support@helpem.ai

---

## Usage Throughout System

### AI Support Bot

When AI is unsure or user is not getting answers, always escalate to:

```
"I want to make sure you get the right help. Our support team at support@helpem.ai can assist you directly."
```

### Escalation Scenarios

**Conservative Triggers:**
- AI confidence <70%
- User seems frustrated or stuck
- Billing/refund issues
- Account deletion/data export requests
- Bug reports from angry users
- Repeated "not helpful" feedback

**Standard Escalation Message:**
```
"I want to make sure you get the best help possible. 

📧 Email: support@helpem.ai
💬 In-app: Settings > Help > Contact Support

[For Basic: Response within 5-7 business days]
[For Premium: Response within 24-48 hours]

Is there anything else I can help you with in the meantime?"
```

## Support Team Workflow

### When Email Arrives

1. **Auto-reply sent** (SLA acknowledgment)
2. **Check AI support logs** (did user already try AI?)
3. **Categorize ticket:**
   - Billing → Handle immediately
   - Bug → Reproduce and escalate to dev
   - How-to → Answer + update AI knowledge base
   - Feature request → Log for product roadmap
4. **Respond within SLA**
5. **Log improvement** (if AI should have handled it)

### Post-Response

1. **Update AI knowledge base** (if new issue pattern)
2. **Add to FAQ** (if common question)
3. **Track resolution time**
4. **Ask for feedback** (optional)

---

## Monitoring & Metrics

### Track Weekly

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Response time (Basic) | <7 days |
| Response time (Premium) | <48 hours |
| First-response resolution | >60% |
| Customer satisfaction | >4.5/5 |
| Volume (tickets/week) | Track trend |

### Red Flags

- Response time exceeding SLA (>7 days Basic, >48hr Premium)
- Volume spike (>50% increase week-over-week)
- Low satisfaction (<4.0/5)
- Repeated issues (AI should be handling)

---

## Integration with AI Support

### Feedback Loop

When human support resolves an issue that AI should have handled:

1. **Log the issue:**
   ```
   Issue: User asked about voice permissions
   AI Response: Escalated (should have answered)
   Human Resolution: Provided step-by-step instructions
   ```

2. **Update AI knowledge base:**
   ```typescript
   // Add to supportAgentInstructions.ts
   **Voice Not Working:**
   1. Check Settings > Privacy > Microphone > helpem
   2. Check Settings > Privacy > Speech Recognition > helpem
   3. Restart app
   4. If still not working → ESCALATE
   ```

3. **Test improvement:**
   - Simulate same question next week
   - Verify AI now handles it correctly

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### 1. Agent Decisiveness (RULE 0)
**Problem**: Agent asking unnecessary confirmation questions  
**Solution**: Added override rule to create tasks immediately with sensible defaults  
**Impact**: Fixed 14 of 19 failures

### 2. Time Parsing Enhancement
**Problem**: Missing edge case time phrases  
**Solution**: Expanded time parsing keywords (later, end of week, next month, in 2 hours)  
**Impact**: Fixed 4 failures

### 3. Multi-Item Detection
**Problem**: "Add eggs, bread, butter" not handled properly  
**Solution**: Added multi-item detection rule  
**Impact**: Fixed grocery list patterns

### 4. Generic Title Acceptance
**Problem**: "Meeting at 3pm" asking for meeting title  
**Solution**: Clarified generic action words are valid titles  
**Impact**: Fixed final failure

### 5. Action Verb Expansion
**Problem**: Not recognizing all action verbs  
**Solution**: Expanded verb list (schedule, make, write, remember, plan, etc.)  
**Impact**: Improved recognition across all categories

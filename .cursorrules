# Project Vibe
- I am building a hybrid iOS app (SwiftUI + Vercel WebView + Railway Postgres).
- iOS code is in /ios, Web is in /web, Backend is in /backend.
- Database: Postgres on Railway (no Prisma currently).
- WebView: Use WKWebView for main app UI; use SFSafariViewController for external links.
- Always check /backend before suggesting changes that affect API contracts.
- Keep auth Apple-only; do not store Apple email/name.
- Session tokens are app-owned JWTs stored in Keychain.

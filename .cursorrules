# Project Vibe
- I am building a hybrid iOS app (SwiftUI + Vercel WebView + Railway Postgres).
- iOS code is in /ios, Web is in /web, Backend is in /backend.
- Database: Postgres on Railway via Prisma.
- WebView: Use SFSafariViewController for external links and WKWebView for the main app UI.
- Always check /backend/schema.prisma before suggesting changes to Swift models.
- Keep auth Apple-only; do not store Apple email/name.
- Session tokens are app-owned JWTs stored in Keychain.
